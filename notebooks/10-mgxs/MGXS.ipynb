    "### Introductory Notation\n",
    "The continuous real-valued microscopic cross section may be denoted $\\sigma_{n,x}(\\mathbf{r}, E)$ for position vector $\\mathbf{r}$, energy $E$, nuclide $n$ and interaction type $x$. Similarly, the scalar neutron flux may be denoted by $\\Phi(\\mathbf{r},E)$ for position $\\mathbf{r}$ and energy $E$. **Note**: Although nuclear cross sections are dependent on the temperature $T$ of the interacting medium, the temperature variable is neglected here for brevity."

    "### Spatial and Energy Discretization\n",
    "The energy domain for critical systems such as thermal reactors spans more than 10 orders of magnitude of neutron energies from 10$^{-5}$ - 10$^7$ eV. The multi-group approximation discretization divides this energy range into one or more energy groups. In particular, for $G$ total groups, we denote an energy group index $g$ such that $g \\in \\{1, 2, ..., G\\}$. The energy group indices are defined such that the smaller group the higher the energy, and vice versa. The integration over neutron energies across a discrete energy group is commonly referred to as **energy condensation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-group cross sections are computed for discretized spatial zones in the geometry of interest. The spatial zones may be defined on a structured and regular fuel assembly or pin cell mesh, an arbitrary unstructured mesh or the constructive solid geometry used by OpenMC. For a geometry with $K$ distinct spatial zones, we designate each spatial zone an index $k$ such that $k \\in \\{1, 2, ..., K\\}$. The volume of each spatial zone is denoted by $V_{k}$. The integration over discrete spatial zones is commonly referred to as **spatial homogenization**."

    "### General Scalar-Flux Weighted MGXS\n",

The equation presented above only discretizes the energy of the incoming neutron and neglects the outgoing energy of the neutron (if any). Hence, this formulation must be extended to account for the outgoing energy of neutrons in the discretized scattering matrix cross section used by deterministic neutron transport codes. \n",

    "### Multi-Group Fission Spectrum\n",
    "The energy spectrum of neutrons emitted from fission is denoted by $\\chi_{n}(\\mathbf{r},E' \\rightarrow E'')$ for incoming and outgoing energies $E'$ and $E''$, respectively. Unlike the multi-group cross sections $\\sigma_{n,x,k,g}$ considered up to this point, the fission spectrum is a probability distribution and must sum to unity. The outgoing energy is typically much less dependent on the incoming energy for fission than for scattering interactions. As a result, it is common practice to integrate over the incoming neutron energy when computing the multi-group fission spectrum. The fission spectrum may be simplified as $\\chi_{n}(\\mathbf{r},E)$ with outgoing energy $E$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the multi-group cross sections defined up to this point, the multi-group fission spectrum is weighted by the fission production rate rather than the scalar flux. This formulation is intended to preserve the total fission production rate in the multi-group deterministic calculation. In order to mathematically define the multi-group fission spectrum, we denote the microscopic fission cross section as $\\sigma_{n,f}(\\mathbf{r},E)$ and the average number of neutrons emitted from fission interactions with nuclide $n$ as $\\nu_{n}(\\mathbf{r},E)$. The multi-group fission spectrum $\\chi_{n,k,g}$ is then the probability of fission neutrons emitted into energy group $g$. \n",
