    "# Source Convergence\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session, we demonstrate how to look at source convergence via a metric called Shannon entropy. Shannon entropy is a concept from information theory that characterizes how much \"information\" a bit stream stores. In the context of eigenvalue calculations, it has been shown that when a source distibution is discretized over a mesh, the entropy of the source probability converges as the distribution itself reaches stationarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shannon entropy is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ H = - \\sum_i p_i \\log_2 p_i $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $p_i$ is the fraction of source particles in mesh cell $i$. The `Settings` object in OpenMC allows us to specify a mesh over which entropy should be calculated. Note that unlike MCNP, the entropy is not automatically calculated otherwise."
